# Entropy Client post branch-upgrade (equo upgrade after successful "equo hop"
# migration script
#
# This is a sample file shipped with client repositories which contains
# per-new-branch setup scripts. More precisely, this script is triggered
# when entropy branch is switched and all the packages have been updated.
# It MUST return 0, any different value will be considered as critical error.
#
# This script must be called with specific arguments explained here below:
#
#     # sh packages.db.post_upgrade.sh [REPO_ID] [ROOT] [OLD_BRANCH] [NEW_BRANCH]
#
# example:
#
#     # sh packages.db.post_branch.sh "sabayonlinux.org" "/" "4" "5"
#
# PLEASE NOTE: this script is called automatically by entropy and, unless
# requested otherwise, it should be NEVER EVER called by user.
