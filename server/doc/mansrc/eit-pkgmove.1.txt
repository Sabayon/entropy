NAME
----
eit-pkgmove - edit automatic package moves for repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
eit pkgmove [-h] <repo>


INTRODUCTION
------------
Packages can be renamed or get their SLOT changed over time (say
thanks to Source Package Managers like Portage :-/).
To ensure that Entropy Clients do update their metadata accordingly,
any change done server-side is recorded into the repository itself.
This tool makes possible to edit such "raw" metadata.
The risk of completely disrupting Entropy Clients (and distro installs)
is very high, use this tool *only, and only if* you know what you're
doing.

-------

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

AUTHORS
-------
Eit has been accidentally prototyped during a rainy Sunday by Fabio
Erculiani who was looking for innovative ways of handling package
bumps in Sabayon Entropy repositories.
A few months later, Eit saw the light.
