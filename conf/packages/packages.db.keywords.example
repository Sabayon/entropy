# Server side packages.db.keywords example file
#
# Keywords mean architectures whose mean which ones are available to entropy
# to try solving package dependencies.
# System keywords are stored internally and are the ones releated to
# the running architecture.
# For example, if you are running 64bit Sabayon, you'll have by default:
#     amd64 and ~amd64.
# Experimental packages are usually tagged with "-*" and/or "" (**) keywords.
# There are multiple ways to "unmask" these packages and will be
# explained below.
#
# PLEASE NOTE: syntax is different from package.keywords due to different
# set of supported features, designed for server-side purposes.

# LINE CONSTRUCTION:
# <atom/dep/mask> [keywords]
# See examples below

# UNIVERSAL UNMASKING:
# Unmasking all packages with -* keyword means writing a like like this
# (without the # marker):
# -*
# or unmasking all packages with no keywords ("" specified here as "**"):
# **
# Note: specifying just one space separated item makes string to be treaten
# as keyword (and not atom/dep!).

# PACKAGES UNMASKING:
# >=media-libs/foo-1.2.3 amd64 ppc ~amd64 ~ppc **
