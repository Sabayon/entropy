NAME
----
eit-lock - lock repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
eit lock [-h] [--client | --status] [--quiet] <repo>


INTRODUCTION
------------
Locking a repository is a way to prevent other Entropy Server
or Entropy Client instances (depending on given switches) from
accessing the remote repository.
In case of Entropy Server locking (default, --client switch not
provided), *eit lock* tries to acquire a remote lock on each configured
mirror that only involves other Entropy Server instances (you won't
be able to update your repositories if you don't own the remote lock).

When --client is provided instead, *eit lock* places a lock on remote
mirrors that prevents Entropy Clients from downloading the repository:
this is just a band aid that avoids users to get broken packages or
repositories.
*eit unlock* does the symmetrical job.

-------

AUTHORS

Eit has been accidentally prototyped during a rainy Sunday by Fabio

bumps in Sabayon Entropy repositories.
A few months later, Eit saw the light.
