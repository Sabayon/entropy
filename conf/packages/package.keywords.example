# package.keywords example file
#
# Keywords mean architectures whose mean which ones are available to entropy
# to try solving package dependencies.
# System keywords are stored internally and are the ones releated to
# the running architecture.
# For example, if you are running 64bit Sabayon, you'll have by default:
#     amd64 and ~amd64.
# Experimental packages are usually tagged with "-*" and/or "" (**) keywords.
# There are multiple ways to "unmask" these packages and will be
# explained below.

# LINE CONSTRUCTION:
# <keyword> <atom||repo=repository id> <atom||repo=repository id>
# See examples below

# UNIVERSAL UNMASKING:
# Unmasking all packages with -* keyword means writing a like like this (without the # marker):
# -*
# or unmasking all packages with no keywords ("" specified here as "**"):
# **

# REPOSITORY UNMASKING:
# Unmasking all packages in a specific repository id called for example "sabayonlinux.org"
# with -* keyword means writing a like like this (without the # marker):
# -* repo=sabayonlinux.org
# or with no keywords ("" specified here as "**"):
# ** repo=sabayonlinux.org

# PACKAGES UNMASKING:
# Unmasking specified packages (one per line, keyworded or full) with -* keyword means writing a like like this (without the # marker):
# -* >=media-libs/foo-1.2.3
# -* media-libs/foo
# -* <media-libs/foo-1.2.3
# -* =media-libs/foo-1.2*
# or with no keywords ("" specified here as "**"):
# ** >=media-libs/foo-1.2.3
# ** media-libs/foo
# ** <media-libs/foo-1.2.3
# ** =media-libs/foo-1.2*

# PACKAGES IN REPOSITORY UNMASKING:
# Unmasking specified packages (one per line, keyworded or full) in a specific repository id called for example
# "sabayonlinux.org" with -* keyword means writing a like like this (without the # marker):
# -* >=media-libs/foo-1.2.3 repo=sabayonlinux.org
# -* media-libs/foo repo=sabayonlinux.org
# -* <media-libs/foo-1.2.3 repo=sabayonlinux.org
# -* =media-libs/foo-1.2* repo=sabayonlinux.org
# Same thing for ** as above.
# You can swap atom and repo=, Entropy doesn't care but the first item must be a KEYWORD!
