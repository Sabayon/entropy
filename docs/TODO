Backlog (raw)

  1.0:

    - preserved-libs registry:
      only drop old sonames when installed packages
      no longer need them

    - conditional deps:
      enabled with ETP_PORTAGE_CONDITIONAL_DEPS_ENABLE
      Test package generation and entropy client behaviour
      (both direct and inverse dependencies calculation)

    - rewrite entropy.Security() to be O(1) (dump sulfur first)

  long term:

    - move variables away from etpConst
      (to SystemSettings || Client || Server as static methods)

  long long term:

    - pkgcore spm plugin
        NEEDED is missing
    - python 3.x support -> more tests
