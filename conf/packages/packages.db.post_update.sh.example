# Entropy Client post repository update (equo update <repoid>) script
# -- called every time repositories are updated --
#
# This is a sample file shipped with client repositories which contains
# per-repository post repository update hook. More precisely, this script is
# triggered when entropy updates repositories. As stated, this script is PER-
# repository and it's shipped with it.
# It MUST return 0, any different value will be considered as critical error.
#
# This script must be called with specific arguments explained here below:
#
#     # sh packages.db.post_upgrade.sh [REPOSITORY_ID] [ROOT] [ENTROPY_BRANCH]
#
# example:
#
#     # sh packages.db.post_branch.sh "sabayonlinux.org" "/" "5"
#
# PLEASE NOTE: this script is called automatically by entropy and, unless
# requested otherwise, it should be NEVER EVER called by user.
